User Reviews and Ratings: Users can post reviews and rate destinations.
Booking System: Allows users to book flights, hotels, and activities.
User Profile: Users can view and manage their bookings and personal information.
Responsive Design: Ensures the app works well on both desktop and mobile devices.
Development Stack
Frontend: React.js, React Router for navigation, Axios for API calls.
Backend: Node.js with Express.js (if building a full-stack app).
Database: MongoDB, Firebase, or another database service (if storing user data and bookings).
Styling: CSS, SCSS, or styled-components.
State Management: Redux or Context API (if necessary).
Development Steps
Setup Project:

Create a new React project using Create React App.
Set up the project structure with folders for components, pages, services, and styles.
Create Components:

Header and Footer: Common layout components.
Home Page Components: Featured destinations, search bar.
Destination Card: For displaying individual destinations.
Destination Details: Detailed information page.
Booking Form: For handling bookings.
Implement Routing:

Use React Router to set up routes for the home page, destination details, user profile, and booking pages.
Set Up State Management:

Implement Redux or Context API to manage global state (e.g., user authentication, search results, bookings).
API Integration:

Use Axios to make API calls to a backend service or third-party APIs for destination data and booking services.
Authentication:

Implement user authentication using JWT, OAuth, or a service like Firebase Authentication.
Styling:

Apply CSS/SCSS or styled-components for styling the app and ensuring a responsive design.
Testing:

Write unit tests for components using Jest and React Testing Library.
Perform end-to-end testing using Cypress or Selenium.
Deployment:

Deploy the frontend using services like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.
If a backend is included, deploy using Heroku, AWS, or another cloud service.
